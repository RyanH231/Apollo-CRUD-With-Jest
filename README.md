# Apollo-CRUD-With-Jest
A project using Apollo Client and Apollo Server to complete CRUD functionality with Mongo Database (connected through Mongoose). Jest testing was performed to test both the Apollo server, and the Mongo CRUD operations. React-Router and Apollo Client fragments and inputs were used for optimizing the client side experience (with custom HTTP headers).
